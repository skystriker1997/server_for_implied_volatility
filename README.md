This project is specified for calculating implied volatility of European option online, based on a http daemon.\
It contains a C source code of daemon, a C source code taking mathematical operation of implied volatility, which could be complied into a cgi program, and an index page.\
The http daemon derived from Tinyhttpd, a tiny http server developed by J. David Blackstone in 1999. You can look into it via http://tinyhttpd.sourceforge.net. I adapted it in some aspects for fitting features I wanted.\
I have tested my whole project on my Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit host and it worked properly.\
Thanks for your advices :)
